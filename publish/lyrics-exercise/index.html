        <p>[1]</p>
    <p>I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill</p>
<p>I threw the day old tea from the cup</p>
<p>Packed up the photo album Matthew had made</p>
<p>Memories of a life that's been loved</p>
<p>Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals</p>
<p>Poured the old ginger beer down the sink</p>
<p>Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"</p>
<p>But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink</p>
<p>Oh I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know</p>
<p>A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved</p>
<p>So I'll sing Hallelujah</p>
<p>You were an angel in the shape of my mum</p>
<p>When I fell down you'd be there holding me up</p>
<p>Spread your wings as you go</p>
<p>And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah</p>
<p>You're home</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>[2]</p>
<p>Fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up</p>
<p>Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case</p>
<p>John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek</p>
<p>And wiped a tear from the side of my face</p>
<p>I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know</p>
<p>A life with love is a life that's been lived</p>
<p>So I'll sing Hallelujah</p>
<p>You were an angel in the shape of my mum</p>
<p>When I fell down you'd be there holding me up</p>
<p>Spread your wings as you go</p>
<p>And when God takes you back we'll say Hallelujah</p>
<p>You're home</p>
<p>Hallelujah</p>
<p>You were an angel in the shape of my mum</p>
<p>You got to see the person I have become</p>
<p>Spread your wings and I know</p>
<p>That when God took you back he said Hallelujah</p>
<p >You're home</p>
<p></p>
