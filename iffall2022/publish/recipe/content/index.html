    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Gelato is the common word in Italian for all kinds of ice cream.
        In English, it specifically refers to a frozen dessert of Italian origin.
        Artisanal gelato in Italy generally contains 6%-9% butterfat, which is lower than other styles of frozen dessert.
        Gelato typically contains 35% air and more flavoring than other kinds of frozen desserts, giving it a density and richness that distinguishes it from other ice creams.
    </section>
   
    <h2>What’s the Difference Between Gelato and Ice Cream?</h2>

<p>Many think that “Gelato” is simply the Italian translation of the English “Ice Cream”, but in reality these two products are different. The differences between these two frozen treats depend on four basic factors: fat content, ingredients, air and temperature.
<p>
    FAT
    Gelato has a lower fat content. Butterfat + fats that come from dried fruit or other origin, do not exceed 8%, of which at least 3.5% butterfat (cream and milk fat). Ice cream, on the other hand, according to the FDA, has a higher butterfat content than gelato: in fact, it cannot be less than 10%.
</p>
<p> 
    INGREDIENTS
    Gelato is made using mainly fresh milk and fresh heavy cream. Instead, powdered milk and vegetable fats are generally used for the production of ice cream.
</p>
<p> 
    AIR
    Gelato melts faster because it contains less air. Ice Cream, on the other hand, melts more slowly thanks to the insulating effect of the air: the law allows it to incorporate air up to 100% of its weight.
</p>
<p>  
    TEMPERATURE
    Gelato has lower storage temperatures, which is why it must be eaten immediately. While ice cream is stored at low temperatures in the freezer as if it were frozen food and, to ensure its durability, it is necessary to add preservatives.

<h2>Tools</h2>
<p>
    Surely the most useful tool for making authentic Italian gelato is an ice cream maker or Gelatiera. There are various types of Gelato makers, but the best is the one that has a compressor that cools while blending the Gelato. We recommend Whynter Automatic Ice Cream Maker.

</p>
<p>

    Making Gelato without an ice cream maker: the result will still be good if you follow our recipe well. In this case you will need a  gelato container. This is useful in any case even if you don’t eat immediately all the gelato, even made with the ice cream maker.

    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <p>
        <li>
        Cooking: 40 minutes (with an ice cream machine) / 4-5 hours (wihtout an icecream machine)
    </li>
    </p>

<p>Step 1) – Whip the egg yolks with the sugar at maximum speed for about 5 minutes, until you have a soft fluffy cream. You can use a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer. You can even beat them by hand with a whisk, but you need more time and the result is not as perfect as with the electric mixer.

</p>

<p>
    Step 2) – Meanwhile, pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it almost to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes.

    THE MILK MUST NOT BOIL
    
    If you have a kitchen thermometer you can check that the temperature remains at about 85°C (185 F). If you don’t have a thermometer, take care to remove the saucepan from the heat or to lower the heat if you see that the milk starts to boil.


</p>

<p>
    At this step, transfer the egg and sugar fluffy cream to a saucepan. Pour the hot milk slowly. Keep mixing while you do it. In this way you are also pasteurizing the eggs. With the exception of flour, the procedure is similar to that of Pastry Cream recipe. If you want to flavor your gelato, this is the time to add either grated lemon zest or two drops of vanilla extract or vanilla bean. Now put it back on the heat and cook for another 5 minutes

WITHOUT BOILING AND ALWAYS STIRRING

Then turn off the heat and add the cold heavy cream. Mix really well. Now let’s show you how to make gelato with and without ice cream maker, so keep reading.
</p>

<p>

    <h3>WITH Ice Cream Maker</h3>
    Step 4/1) – Now if you have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into the machine and start it. It will take about 40 minutes, depending on the model. After the necessary time, your gelato is ready! Fresh, creamy and nutritious.

PLEASE NOTE: The best ice cream maker you can find on the market is the one with a compressor that cools while churning the gelato. This ice cream maker is very similar to the professional ones and is the one we used for this recipe.

Read how to store it in the paragraph below.

If you don’t have an gelato maker, in the next paragraph we’ll show you how to make ice cream without an ice cream maker
</p>

<p>
    <h3>WITHOUT Ice Cream Maker</h3>
    <p>
        If you don’t have a gelato maker, don’t worry! We are going to show you how to make Italian gelato without the help of an ice cream maker. It takes more time (5 hours instead of about 40 minutes) and more work but the result is still exceptional! Let’s see how to do it!

    </p>
    <p>
        Step 4/2) – Pour the mixture into a gelato container and place it in the freezer for about 5 hours. Every 30 minutes you have to break the frozen surface. So remove from the freezer and mix for about 30 seconds using a hand whisk or an electric whisk on low speed. This step is necessary in order not to create ice crystals in the gelato and have a creamy result. Of course this is a bit more laborious process, but it’s worth it. You will surely have an exquisite authentic Italian Gelato!

    </p>
    <p>This website posts recipes for those who have an icecream maker and those who don't. Since it is not a common tool to have for most people, the recipe without using the maker is very helpful.
        I also like that writer uses informal language, as people would find it easier to read and understand. </p>
<p>2. <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/55609/gelato/"> Allrecipes</a>
</p>
<p>I like that this website has a review section where people who actually tried the recipe write their comments about it. People can expect how their gelato turns out if they follow the recipe.</p>
<p>3. <a href="https://www.tasteofhome.com/recipes/lemon-gelato/""> Taste of Home </a>
</p>
<p> I think using the "Testkichenapproved"mark, the mark that is given to the recipes that have been approved by the professional., for every single recipe is a really good idea, since it gives credibility to it. </p>

<h2>Other websites</h2>

1. <a href=https://www.ted.com/>TED</a>
<p>I think it was a smart idea to list multiple thumnails on their default page while keeping the other elements simple by using only white and red. Websites like Ted where the main contents are videos, need to have a stronger element that can attract people, because it takes much longer to watch a video.   </p>


2. <a href=https://www.nytimes.com/>The New York Times/</a>
<p> I like that It keeps the traditional layout of newspaper by placcing the title at the center of the top margin in its original font. Also, I think the white and black contrast and the choice of font give seriousness to the website.
