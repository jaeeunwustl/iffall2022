   <h1>Introductory Questions</h1>
   <p>1. Name:Jaeeun Kim, Majors: Communication Design, Linguistics, Minor: Psychological& Brain Sciences, Year in Scool: Junior </p> 
   <p>2. I have no experience with programming languages, but I've always been interested in UX Design and felt the need to learn relevant skills.</p>
   <p>3. This is my first time learning HTML/CSS/JS. I haven't taken any computer-related classes before. </p>
   <p>4. I hope to build a solid foundation for more advanced classes.</p>
   <p>5. Designers have to consider the interaction and consistency of multiple pages or elements since what people see on their screens changes every time they move their cursors or scroll up and down. </p>
   <p>6. <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/"> NewYorkTimes </a> I think the New York Times website has effective design. It keeps the traditional layout of newspaper by placing the title at the center of the top margin in its original font, while making use of the interective visual effects of web design.</p>
   <p>7. <a>https://www.artsy.net/artists </a> I think Artsy's website is effectively designed for communication between artists and consumers. It's easy to find artwork and artists by category, and there's also a follow button and a description of the artwork next to the sample pictures. I think these features make it easy for the public to access and buy artwork.</p> 
   <p>8. <a>https://www.amazon.com/ref=nav_logo </a> I personally use this website everyday and have always thought it works very well. The arrangment of products and photos are straightfoward and simple but it serves its purpose effectively.</p>
